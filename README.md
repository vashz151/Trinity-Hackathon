MY VOTE

Problem: As of now, voting takes place in a traditional centralized manner which leads to tampering of votes and is devoid of transparency. This makes the voting process tedious and unreliable for the users.  The votes can be changed as well. 
This creates the entire voting process not safe due to which the users are reluctant to give their vote.

Solution: Implemented a decentralized voting system using blockchain which stores all the voting events and the voting records on blockchain which makes it impossible to tamper with. Only the skateholder or the owner can create the voting events. Our application provides multilingual support (english and hindi). We verify the users who want to cast their vote by using three factor authentication. First the user has to put in the secret code provided by the owner. After this sms verfication is performed on the registered phone number. After verifying, face recognition is done to. verify the user. Once these steps are successfully done, the user can cast their vote in the election.
Post the elections, the owner can view the results.
